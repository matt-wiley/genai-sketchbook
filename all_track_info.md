## From Meh to Marvelous: Supercharging Your Research Team Meetings
Tuesday, 8 October 2024 4:05pm - 4:35pm

### Description: 

As research leaders, meetings with our researchers are table stakes. Yet, how often do we reflect on the efficacy of those meetings, or consider how we might supercharge time with our team to achieve key outcomes? How can we avoid having our teams think, "That could've been an email"? At Vanguard, we work alongside research leaders who oversee upwards of 100 researchers. Some teams are small (~5), while others are large (~40). Across the leadership team, we've adopted different meetings for different purposes. In this session, we'll share how we spend time with our team, including:

Frameworks for conceptualizing meeting goals and cadences
Sample agendas
Examples of exercises we run to get stuff done
Verbatims from researchers on how it's going and where we still have opportunities to tweak

To that end, while we've tried a lot of different things, we by no means have it all figured out. This session is about mutual idea exchange. What have you put in place to drive team engagement, facilitate idea sharing, and generally move things forward with your team?
